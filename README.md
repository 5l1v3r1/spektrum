# spektrum

### "The SV mod" - UI improvements by SV1SGK and SV8ARJ. W.I.P.

Download the latest test build (v0.19a_07-NOE-18) from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c7vjbvm0mhi4xqu/AAAnuL9OkGZnQfcmRo2nRf8Ia?dl=0).
-------
- Please report bugs/comments before our pull request. The rtlsdr.dll and rtlpower.dll included (in the lib folder) are from previous version of spektrum (v1.0.2). Latest versions (also included but renamed to ****.dll-latest) were giving us a grey screen (not working). YMMV.

Goals : 
-------
To make an excellent utility easy to use.
73's from Nick and George.

Progress so far 
---------------
- Added: 2 Cursors for Frequency axis.
- Added: 2 Cursors for Amplitude axis.
- Added: Absolute and differential measurements with cursors.
- Added: Zoom functionality of the cursors's defined area (gain + frequency).
- Added: _Mouse Wheel_ Gain limits adjustment on graph (Top area for upper, Bottom area for lower limit).
- Added: _Mouse Wheel_ Frequency limits adjustment on graph (left area for lower frequency, right for upper).
- Added: _Mouse Wheel_ in the centrer of the graph performs symetric zoom in/out.
- Added: View/settings store/recall (elementary "back" operation, nice for quick zoomed in graph inspection).
- Added: _Right click_ positions primary cursors.
- Added: _Right Double Click_ positions primary cursors and moves secondary out of the way.
- Added: _Right Click and Drag_ defines area using primary and secondary cursors, also interactive Delta measurements.
- Added: _Left Double Click_ zooms area defined by cursors (Amplitude + frequency).
- Added: _Left Mouse Click and Drag_ on a cursor moves the cursor.
- Added: _Middle (mouse wheel) Double Click_ resets full scale for Amplitude and Frequency.
- Added: _Middle (mouse wheel) Click and Drag_, moves the graph recalculating limits accordingly.
- Added: Reset buttons to Min/Max range next to Start and Stop frequency text boxes.
- Modified: Cursors on/off now operate on all 4 cursors.
- Added: ZOOM and BACK buttons.
- Added: Display of frequency, Amplitude and differences for all cursors.
- Modified: Button layout.
- Fixed: Save/Reload settings on exit/start.
- Added: Filled graph option (line or area).
- Added: VSWR calculation display for the antenna tunning guys (delta db from curosrs to VSWR).
- Added: Reference graph save / display.
- Added: Video averaging, useful on fast refresh (zoomed in).
- Added: Minimum, Maximum hold (persistent display).
- Added: Median value display (middle value between Max and Min).
- Added: IF frequency basic support (only Upper band displays left to right in ascending order).
- Added: Average graph can be saved as reference (if active when "save reference" is clicked).
- Added: Vertical offset for reference graph (controled from knob).
- Added: Quick help reference screen (mouse operation).
- Modified: RF gain is now a rotary knob plus 3 buttons for 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 presets.
- Modified: Created a tabed interface to make room for further development.
- Added: 9+1 Presets plus controls to modify and recall.
- Added: Graph smoothing using RTL crop. (rtlspektrum library wraper recompiled to export the "crop" setting).
- Modified: Behaviour of mouse and delete key in text fields from [here](https://github.com/Viproz/controlp5/releases/tag/v2.2.7) (controIP5 library fix by @Viproz, Thanks !).

Original readme starts here:
----------------------------



Spektrum is spectrum analyzer software for use with [rtl-sdr](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr).

Biggest advantage is that it can do sweeps across large frequency span.

User interface part is written in [Processing](https://processing.org/)

Quick Start
-----------

Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/pavels/spektrum/releases) for your OS and unpack it somewhere.

Connect and configure your rtl-sdr stick ( follow [this guide](http://rtlsdr.org/softwarewindows) for windows).

Launch the software.

**If you are running windows version and only thing you see is grey screen, you need to install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 - Get them from [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679)**

Usage
-----

Usage is fairly simple

* Tweak parameters like frequency range, scale, tuner gain or offset tuning to suite your needs.
* Base display is average for each point, turn "min/max" to also see minimums and maximums for every displayed point.

Relative mode
-----

Relative mode allows you to "zero" the measurement and is useful for measurements with noise constant sources

You can find example here [http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-measuring-filter-characteristics-and-antenna-vswr-with-an-rtl-sdr-and-noise-source/](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-measuring-filter-characteristics-and-antenna-vswr-with-an-rtl-sdr-and-noise-source/)

* Connect your noise source
* Set desired frequency range
* Click "Relative mode"
* Wait couple of sweeps - it will do running average of all collected data
* Click "Set relative" to set captured spectrum as reference. You should now see fairly straight line around 0dB
* Connect antenna or filter and tweak gain so you see what is desired

Background
----

Two libraries is needed to run the code

* rtl-sdr rtlpower - special branch, where rtlpower is separated into library, so we don't need to run the binary rtlpower. 
* java bridge - processing library to interface with rtlpower

The rtl-sdr branch is located here: [https://github.com/pavels/rtl-sdr](https://github.com/pavels/rtl-sdr)

The processing library is here [https://github.com/pavels/processing-rtlspektum-lib](https://github.com/pavels/processing-rtlspektum-lib)

Development
----

You need 

* Processing development environment [https://processing.org/](https://processing.org/)
* rtlspektrum processing library [https://github.com/pavels/processing-rtlspektum-lib/releases](https://github.com/pavels/processing-rtlspektum-lib/releases) (unpack latest rtlspektrum.zip into your processing libraries folder)

What is missing?
----

* Bugfixes - yep, there is most certainly bugs
* Cursors - proper cursors for measurement would be nice
* Better UX - the UI is pile of controls, no design, nothing
* Better README - this one is a bit crude
