spektrum
==========

Spektrum is spectrum analyzer software for use with rtl-sdr.

Biggest advantage is that it can do sweeps across large frequency span.

User interface part is written in [Processing](https://processing.org/)

Quick Start
-----------

Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/pavels/spektrum/releases) for your OS and unpack it somewhere.

Connect and configure your rtl-sdr stick ( follow [this guide](http://rtlsdr.org/softwarewindows) for windows).

Launch the software.

Usage
-----

Usage is fairly simple

* Tweak parameters like frequency range, scale, tuner gain or offset tuning to suite your needs.
* Base display is average for each point, turn "min/max" to also see minimums and maximums for every displayed point.

Relative mode
-----

Relative mode allows you to "zero" the measurement and is useful for measurements with noise constant sources

You can find example here [http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-measuring-filter-characteristics-and-antenna-vswr-with-an-rtl-sdr-and-noise-source/](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-measuring-filter-characteristics-and-antenna-vswr-with-an-rtl-sdr-and-noise-source/)

* Connect your noise source
* Set desired frequency range
* Click "Relative mode"
* Wait couple of sweeps - it will do running average of all collected data
* Click "Set relative" to set captured spectrum as reference. You should now see fairly straight line around 0dB
* Connect antenna or filter and tweak gain so you see what is desired

Background
----

Two libraries is needed to run the code

* rtl-sdr rtlpower - special branch, where rtlpower is separated into library, so we don't need to run the binary rtlpower. 
* java bridge - processing library to interface with rtlpower

The rtl-sdr branch is located here: [https://github.com/pavels/rtl-sdr](https://github.com/pavels/rtl-sdr)

The processing library is here [https://github.com/pavels/processing-rtlspektum-lib](https://github.com/pavels/processing-rtlspektum-lib)

Development
----

You need 

* Processing development environment [https://processing.org/](https://processing.org/)
* rtlspektrum processing library [https://github.com/pavels/processing-rtlspektum-lib/releases](https://github.com/pavels/processing-rtlspektum-lib/releases) (unpack latest rtlspektrum.zip into your processing libraries folder)

What is missing?
----

* Bugfixes - yep, there is most certainly bugs
* Cursors - proper cursors for measurement would be nice
* Better UX - the UI is pile of controls, no design, nothing
* Better README - this one is a bit crude


Contributing
-----
